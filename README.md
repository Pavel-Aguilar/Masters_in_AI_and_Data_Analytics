# Master's in AI & Data Analytics: Coursework & Projects

This repository serves as a consolidated collection of practical exercises, projects, and assignments completed as part of my Master's degree program in Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics. It documents my hands-on learning experience and skill development in key areas of the field.

## About This Repository

This repository was created to organize and showcase the practical work undertaken during my Master's studies. It includes code implementations, data analysis workflows, statistical explorations, and project solutions from specific courses.

The goal is to:
* Maintain a structured record of my academic progress.
* Provide tangible examples of my programming and analytical skills.
* Serve as a reference for concepts and techniques learned.
* Share my work with potential collaborators or employers.

## Coursework Included

This repository contains materials primarily from the following Master's courses:

### 1. Programming for Descriptive and Predictive Analytics

This section includes practices focused on developing programming skills essential for data handling, exploration, and predictive modeling. Topics covered typically involve:

* **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** Handling various data formats, cleaning missing values, transforming data.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Summarizing data, visualizing distributions and relationships.
* **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculating and interpreting key statistical measures.
* **Predictive Modeling:** Implementing and evaluating machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.) for prediction and classification tasks.
* **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics.
* **Using Core Libraries:** Extensive use of libraries such as `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Scikit-learn`, etc.

### 2. Mathematics and Statistics for Artificial Intelligence

This section contains exercises and implementations related to the mathematical and statistical foundations that underpin many AI and Machine Learning algorithms. Practices here demonstrate understanding of concepts such as:

* **Linear Algebra:** Vector and matrix operations, eigenvalues/eigenvectors, decomposition.
* **Calculus:** Gradients, derivatives, optimization techniques relevant to model training.
* **Probability Theory:** Understanding probability distributions, conditional probability, Bayes' theorem.
* **Statistics:** Hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, regression analysis fundamentals, statistical modeling principles.
* **Mathematical Concepts in Algorithms:** Implementing mathematical components of algorithms from scratch or using libraries like `NumPy` and `SciPy`.

## Tools and Technologies Used

The projects and practices in this repository were developed using:

* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb):** Used extensively for exploratory analysis, visualization, and step-by-step code execution (often in Google Colab).
* **Python Scripts (.py):** Used for more structured code, functions, and project components (often developed in PyCharm).
* **Key Python Libraries:**
    * `Pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
    * `NumPy` for numerical operations.
    * `Scikit-learn` for machine learning algorithms.
    * `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for data visualization.
    * `SciPy` for scientific and technical computing.
    * *(Add any other libraries you frequently use, e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, StatsModels)*
* **Development Environments:** Practices were carried out using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and [Google Colaboratory (Colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/).
